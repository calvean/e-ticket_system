In this example, the app/ directory contains the main application code, while the routes/ directory contains all the routes split into individual files. The templates/ directory contains all the HTML templates split into subdirectories for each entity.

The __init__.py file in the app/ and routes/ directories is used to define the Flask application and register the routes, respectively.

The config.py file contains the configuration settings for the application, such as the database connection information and secret key.

The database.py file contains the code for creating and managing the database connection.

The models.py file defines the database models using SQLAlchemy.
